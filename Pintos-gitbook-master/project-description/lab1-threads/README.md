# Lab1: Threads

Your job is to **extend the functionality of this system to gain a better understanding of synchronization problems.**

* You will be working primarily in the `threads/` directory for this assignment, with some work in the `devices/` directory on the side.
* Compilation should be done in the `threads/` directory.

Before you read the description of this project, you should read all the sections in [GETTING STARTED](broken-reference/) and [C Standards](../../appendix/coding-standards.md) section. You should at least skim the previous four sections in [Code Guide](../../appendix/reference-guide/), especially [Synchronization](../../appendix/reference-guide/synchronization.md). **To complete this project you will also need to read** [**4.4BSD Scheduler**](../../appendix/4.4bsd-scheduler.md)**.**

**Here are the sections in this chapter:**

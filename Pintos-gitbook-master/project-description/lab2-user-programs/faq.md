## General FAQ

#### The kernel always panics when I run `pintos -p file -- -q`.

Did you format the file system (with `pintos -- -f`)?

Is your file name too long? The file system limits file names to 14 characters. A command like `pintos -p ../../examples/echo -- -q` will exceed the limit. Use `pintos -p ../../examples/echo -a echo -- -q` to put the file under the name `echo` instead.

Is the file system full?

Does the file system already contain 16 files? The base Pintos file system has a 16-file limit.

The file system may be so fragmented that there's not enough contiguous space for your file.

#### When I run `pintos -p ../file --`, file isn't copied.

Files are written under the name you refer to them, by default, so in this case the file copied in would be named `../file`. You probably want to run `pintos -p ../file -a file --` instead.

You can list the files in your file system with `pintos -- -q ls`.

#### All my user programs die with page faults.

This will happen if you haven't implemented argument passing (or haven't done so correctly). The basic C library for user programs tries to read `argc` and `argv` off the stack. If the stack isn't properly set up, this causes a page fault.

#### All my user programs die with `system call!`

You'll have to implement system calls before you see anything else. Every reasonable program tries to make at least one system call (`exit()`) and most programs make more than that. Notably, `printf()` invokes the `write` system call. The default system call handler just prints `system call!` and terminates the program. Until then, you can use `hex_dump()` to convince yourself that argument passing is implemented correctly (see section [Program Startup Details](background.md#program-startup-details)).

#### How can I disassemble user programs?

The `objdump` (80x86) or `i386-elf-objdump` (SPARC) utility can disassemble entire user programs or object files. Invoke it as `objdump -d file`. You can use GDB's `disassemble` command to disassemble individual functions.

#### Why do many C include files not work in Pintos programs? Can I use libfoo in my Pintos programs?

The C library Pintos provides is very limited. It does not include many of the features that are expected of a real operating system's C library. The C library must be built specifically for the operating system (and architecture), since it must make system calls for I/O and memory allocation. (Not all functions do, of course, but usually the library is compiled as a unit.)

The chances are good that the library you want uses parts of the C library that Pintos doesn't implement. It will probably take at least some porting effort to make it work under Pintos. Notably, the Pintos user program C library does not have a `malloc()` implementation.

#### How do I compile new user programs?

Modify `src/examples/Makefile`, then run `make`.

#### Can I run user programs under a debugger?

Yes, with some limitations. See section [GDB](../../getting-started/debug-and-test/debugging.md#gdb).

#### What's the difference between `tid_t` and `pid_t`?

A `tid_t` identifies a kernel thread, which may have a user process running in it (if created with `process_execute()`) or not (if created with `thread_create()`). It is a data type used only in the kernel.

A `pid_t` identifies a user process. It is used by user processes and the kernel in the `exec` and `wait` system calls.

You can choose whatever suitable types you like for `tid_t` and `pid_t`. By default, they're both `int`. You can make them a one-to-one mapping, so that the same values in both identify the same process, or you can use a more complex mapping. It's up to you.

## Argument Passing FAQ

#### Isn't the top of stack in kernel virtual memory?

The top of stack is at `PHYS_BASE`, typically 0xc0000000, which is also where kernel virtual memory starts. But before the processor pushes data on the stack, it decrements the stack pointer. Thus, the first (4-byte) value pushed on the stack will be at address 0xbffffffc.

#### Is `PHYS_BASE` fixed?

No. You should be able to support `PHYS_BASE` values that are any multiple of 0x10000000 from 0x80000000 to 0xf0000000, simply via recompilation.

## System Calls FAQ

#### What happens when an open file is removed?

You should implement **the standard Unix semantics for files**. That is, when a file is removed any process which has a file descriptor for that file may continue to use that descriptor. This means that they can read and write from the file. The file will not have a name, and no other processes will be able to open it, but it will continue to exist until all file descriptors referring to the file are closed or the machine shuts down.

#### Can I just cast a `struct file *` to get a file descriptor? Can I just cast a `struct thread *` to get a `pid_t`?

You will have to make these design decisions yourself. Most operating systems do distinguish between file descriptors (or pids) and the addresses of their kernel data structures. You might want to give some thought as to why they do so before committing yourself.

#### Can I set a maximum number of open files per process?

It is better not to set an arbitrary limit. You may impose a limit of 128 open files per process, if necessary.

#### How can I run user programs that need more than 4 kB stack space?

You may modify the stack setup code to allocate more than one page of stack space for each process. In the next project, you will implement a better solution.

#### What should happen if an `exec` fails midway through loading?

`exec` should return -1 if the child process fails to load for any reason. This includes the case where the load fails part of the way through the process (e.g. where it runs out of memory in the `multi-oom` test). Therefore, the parent process cannot return from the `exec` system call until it is established whether the load was successful or not. The child must communicate this information to its parent using appropriate synchronization, such as a semaphore, to ensure that the information is communicated without race conditions.

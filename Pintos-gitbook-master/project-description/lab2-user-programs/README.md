# Lab2: User Programs

Now that you've worked with Pintos and are becoming familiar with its infrastructure and thread package, **it's time to start working on the parts of the system that allow running user programs.**

* **The base code already supports loading and running user programs, but no I/O or interactivity is possible.** In this project, you will enable programs to interact with the OS via system calls.
* You will be working out of the `userprog/` directory for this assignment, but you will also be interacting with almost every other part of Pintos. We will describe the relevant parts below.

<mark style="color:red;">**No code from other project is required for this assignment.**</mark>

You might find it useful to go back and reread how to run the tests (see section [Testing](../../getting-started/debug-and-test/testing.md)).

**Here are the sections in this chapter:**

# Memory Allocation

{% hint style="info" %}
**Pintos contains two memory allocators**, one that allocates **memory** **in units of a \_page**\_, and one that can allocate _**blocks**_ **of any size**.
{% endhint %}

## Page allocator

**The page allocator declared in `threads/palloc.h` allocates memory in units of a page.**

* It is most often used to allocate memory **one page** at a time, but it can also allocate **multiple contiguous pages** at once.

### Memory Pools

**The page allocator divides the memory it allocates into two pools**, called <mark style="color:red;">**the kernel and user pools**</mark>.

* **By default, each pool gets&#x20;**_**half**_ **of system memory above 1 MB**, but the division can be changed with the `-ul` kernel command line option.
* **An allocation request draws from one pool or the other.** If one pool becomes empty, the other may still have free pages.
* _<mark style="color:red;">**The user pool**</mark>_ <mark style="color:red;">**should be used for allocating memory for user processes and**</mark> _<mark style="color:red;">**the kernel pool**</mark>_ <mark style="color:red;">**for all other allocations.**</mark>  <mark style="color:red;">**Until then, all allocations should be made from**</mark> _<mark style="color:red;">**the kernel pool**</mark>_.
* **Each pool's usage is tracked with a bitmap, one bit per page in the pool.** A request to allocate n pages scans the bitmap for n consecutive bits set to false, indicating that those pages are free, and then sets those bits to true to mark them as used. This is a **"first fit" allocation strategy** (see [Wilson](../bibliography.md#operating-system-design-references)).

### Types and Functions

Page allocator types and functions are described below.

<details>

<summary>Types and Functions for Page Allocator</summary>

* <mark style="color:blue;">**Function: void \*palloc\_get\_page (enum palloc\_flags flags)**</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Function: void \*palloc\_get\_multiple (enum palloc\_flags flags, size\_t page\_cnt)**</mark>
  * **Obtains and returns one page, or page\_cnt contiguous pages, respectively.** Returns a null pointer if the pages cannot be allocated.
  * The **flags** argument may be any combination of the following flags:
  * <mark style="color:orange;">**`PAL_ASSERT`**</mark>
    * **If the pages cannot be allocated, panic the kernel.**
    * This is only appropriate during kernel initialization.User processes should never be permitted to panic the kernel.
  * <mark style="color:orange;">**`PAL_ZERO`**</mark>
    * **Zero all the bytes in the allocated pages before returning them.** If not set, the contents of newly allocated pages are unpredictable.
  * <mark style="color:orange;">**`PAL_USER`**</mark>
    * **Obtain the pages from the user pool.** If not set, pages are allocated from the kernel pool.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Function: void palloc\_free\_page (void \*page)**</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Function: void palloc\_free\_multiple (void \*pages, size\_t page\_cnt)**</mark>
  * **Frees one page, or page\_cnt contiguous pages, respectively, starting at pages.**
  * All of the pages must have been obtained using `palloc_get_page()` or `palloc_get_multiple()`.

</details>

### Notes

* **The page allocator is subject to fragmentation.** That is, it may not be possible to allocate n contiguous pages even though n or more pages are free, because the free pages are separated by used pages. In fact, in pathological cases it may be impossible to allocate 2 contiguous pages even though half of the pool's pages are free. Single-page requests can't fail due to fragmentation, so requests for multiple contiguous pages should be limited as much as possible.
* **Pages may not be allocated from interrupt context, but they may be freed.**
* **When a page is freed, all of its bytes are cleared to `0xcc`**, as a debugging aid (see section [Tips](../../getting-started/debug-and-test/debugging.md#tips)).

## Block allocator

**The block allocator, declared in `threads/malloc.h`, can allocate blocks of any size.**

* It is **layered on top of the page allocator** described in the previous section.
* Blocks returned by the block allocator are <mark style="color:red;">**obtained from the kernel pool**</mark>.

**The block allocator uses two different strategies for allocating memory.**

1. The first strategy applies to **blocks that are 1 kB or smaller** (one-fourth of the page size). These allocations are **rounded up to the nearest power of 2, or 16 bytes**, whichever is larger. Then they are grouped into a page used only for allocations of that size.
2. The second strategy applies to **blocks larger than 1 kB**. These allocations (plus a small amount of overhead) are **rounded up to the nearest page in size**, and then the block allocator requests that number of contiguous pages from the page allocator.

Do you get deja vu? Did you implement these strategies in the Malloc Lab in ICS?
{% endhint %}

### Types and Functions

The block allocator functions are described below. **Their interfaces are the same as the standard C library functions of the same names.**

<details>

<summary>Functions for Block Allocator</summary>

* <mark style="color:blue;">**Function: void \*malloc (size\_t size)**</mark>
  * **Obtains and returns a new block,&#x20;**<mark style="color:red;">**from the kernel pool**</mark>**, at least size bytes long.** Returns a null pointer if size is zero or if memory is not available.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Function: void \*calloc (size\_t a, size\_t b)**</mark>
  * **Obtains a returns a new block,&#x20;**<mark style="color:red;">**from the kernel pool**</mark>**, at least `a * b` bytes long.** **The block's contents will be cleared to zeros.** Returns a null pointer if a or b is zero or if insufficient memory is available.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Function: void \*realloc (void \*block, size\_t new\_size)**</mark>
  * **Attempts to resize block to new\_size bytes, possibly moving it in the process.** If successful, returns the new block, in which case the old block must no longer be accessed. On failure, returns a null pointer, and the old block remains valid.
  * A call with block null is equivalent to `malloc()`. A call with new\_size zero is equivalent to `free()`.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Function: void free (void \*block)**</mark>
  * **Frees block, which must have been previously returned by `malloc()`, `calloc()`, or `realloc()` (and not yet freed).**

</details>

### Notes

* **In either case, the difference between the allocation requested size and the actual block size is wasted.** A real operating system would carefully tune its allocator to minimize this waste, but this is unimportant in an instructional system like Pintos.
* **As long as a page can be obtained from the page allocator, small allocations always succeed.** Most small allocations do not require a new page from the page allocator at all, because they are satisfied using part of a page already allocated.
* However, **large allocations always require calling into the page allocator, and any allocation that needs more than one contiguous page can fail due to fragmentation**, as already discussed in the previous section. Thus, <mark style="color:red;">**you should minimize the number of large allocations in your code, especially those over approximately 4 kB each**</mark>.
* **When a block is freed, all of its bytes are cleared to `0xcc`**, as a debugging aid (see section [Tips](../../getting-started/debug-and-test/debugging.md#tips)).
* **The block allocator may not be called from interrupt context.**
